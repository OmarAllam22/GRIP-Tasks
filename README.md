# Market Sales EDA

This is an analysis task which I was assigned to in my datat science internship at The Sparks Foundation. 

This task was to preform an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on a SampleSuperStore dataset.

My target was to get the factor by which I can transform the -ve profit to be +ve one and therefore increase this +ve profit. 
So I have explored the data to discover which factors affect my target.
